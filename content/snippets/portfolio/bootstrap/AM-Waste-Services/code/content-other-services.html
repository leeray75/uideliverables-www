<p><strong>RECYCLING FACILITIES</strong></p>
<p>AM Waste recycles ALL  materials that come through our sorting facility. We believe in taking care of  our environment and part of that responsibility is reusing materials to  increase their lifespan. This is what is best for the environment. We offer one  flat-fee which depends on the materials you are disposing of.</p>

<p><strong>COMPACTOR SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>COMPACTORS     AM  Waste Compactors are fully enclosed containers varying in size from 2 to 40  cubic yards. They utilize a mechanical blade within the container to compact  the waste to maximize the amount of materials that can be loaded into the  container. These containers must have access to electrical power from which to  operate the mechanical blade. Most compactor customers generate high levels of  waste or recyclable materials and benefit greatly from the maximization of  space available for waste. The upfront cost of a compactor is higher than other  types of containers, however savings are gained due to the significantly fewer  collections needed over time<br />
