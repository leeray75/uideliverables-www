    <h3>Project Description: </h3>
    <p>We have a client, AM Waste, that needs a responsive website built. </p>
    <p> We are looking for a website developer to design and code a five page site. Must use Bootstrap 3 framework. Must be responsive. We are in the digital advertising business, so it is required that the website is built with capturing conversions and generating phone calls. For example, well-placed lead forms and click-to-call buttons on phone numbers on mobile devices.</p>
    <p> We have an istockphoto "essentials" subscription. So any that you use from there we should be able to download for you.</p>
    <p> We would like to have a turnaround time for the first draft (can be a PNG) within 10 business days. We then send the first draft to the client for review. Once we receive feedback from the client we would like revisions made until the client is satisfied.</p>
    <p> Please see the attachments for more info. </p>
    <p> Client would like to keep their current logo. </p>
