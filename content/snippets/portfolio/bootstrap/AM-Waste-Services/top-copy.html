  <p>I created a Bootstrap demo website from a project that was posted on <a href="http://www.freelancer.com" target="_blank">Freelancer</a>. I built this before being awarded the project. As of right now (February 15, 2015), the owner of the project hasn't awarded it to anyone. I made a bid and submitted the demo to the owner.</p>
  <p>The site is coded with the these technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Less.js and Bootstrap.</p>
  <p> The client's website is AM Waste Services </p>
