His original code only gets the list of comments when the page loads. It then updates the list when the user adds or deletes an item without syncing it back up with the database. My changes now allows the code to sync up the list with the database every time a user adds or deletes a comment. I only had to make a few minor updates the comments.php and the controller's AngularJS code.
